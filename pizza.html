        <h2> Discription</h2>
<p>
    pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped with some combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked quickly—usually, in a commercial setting, using a wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature—and served hot 
</p>
<h3>ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>cheese</li>
    <li>tomato-sauce</li>
    <li>all-purpose-flour</li>
    <li>olives</li>
</ul>
<h4>steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li><p>If you have one, place a pizza stone in the oven and heat oven to 500ºF (if you can’t heat oven this high without broiling, set to 475ºF). Dust a baking sheet with cornmeal. </p></li>
    <li> <p>On a lightly floured surface, shape pizza dough into a 14- to 16-in oval or circle and place on prepared sheet (make sure that the dough slides easily around the sheet, if not, add a bit more cornmeal).  </p></li>
    <li> Spread sauce on dough, leaving a ½-in boarder all the way around and sprinkle with mozzarella and then Parmesan. If using a stone, slide the pizza off the sheet onto the stone. Bake until crust is golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Sprinkle with basil just before serving, if desired.</li>
